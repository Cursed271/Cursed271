## Featured Projects üíª

- üîß RiskIntel: RiskIntel is an external threat reconnaissance and threat modeling Python tool designed to automate the process of identifying potential security threats. By scanning various online resources, RiskIntel gathers critical data about an organization‚Äôs attack surface and compiles a detailed report, identifying vulnerabilities and threat vectors. This tool significantly enhances a security team‚Äôs ability to assess their security posture early, reducing time spent on manual threat hunting.
- üõ°Ô∏è CipherStrike: CipherStrike is a robust Python tool developed to automate the process of testing the security of encryption algorithms. It performs a wide range of attacks, such as brute force and cryptanalysis, to evaluate how securely data is protected using different cipher methods. By testing real-world encryption systems against a series of pre-defined attack models, CipherStrike helps developers and security teams identify weaknesses in cryptographic implementations.
- üìä BenchParse: BenchParse is a powerful Python tool designed to extract and parse CIS benchmark data from PDFs into structured Excel sheets. It automates the tedious process of converting PDF-based benchmarks into actionable insights, allowing security professionals to quickly evaluate system compliance and identify security gaps. The tool provides users with detailed control lists, including titles, descriptions, rationales, and recommendations from CIS controls, making it easier for compliance and security teams to assess the security posture of their systems.
- üîç VulnReportX: VulnReportX is an upcoming CLI-based tool designed to simplify the process of generating detailed security reports for vulnerability assessments. It will integrate findings from network, web, and application penetration testing into a comprehensive, well-organized report that includes CVE mappings, severity scores, and recommendations. With VulnReportX, security professionals can quickly create reports that can be shared with stakeholders, making it easier to communicate risk levels and necessary remediation steps.
